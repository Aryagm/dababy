# DaBaby - Intelligent Baby Cry Analysis System

An advanced baby cry monitoring and analysis application that uses heuristic algorithms to detect potential health issues in infants through acoustic analysis.

## Features

### Real-time Monitoring
- Continuous audio monitoring with visual waveform display
- Automatic cry detection and analysis
- Real-time processing with 3-second analysis windows

### Comprehensive Heuristic Analysis

The system implements multiple detection algorithms based on clinical research:

#### 1. **Hyperphonation Detection**
- Detects voiced frames with F0 > 1000 Hz for ‚â•150ms
- Flags potential neurological distress
- **Clinical Significance**: May indicate brain injury or neurological issues

#### 2. **Hoarseness Pattern Recognition**
- Monitors HNR < 5-7 dB, jitter > 1.5%, shimmer > 3-5%
- **Clinical Significance**: May suggest laryngeal issues or hypothyroidism

#### 3. **Cri-du-chat Syndrome Detection**
- Identifies cat-like cry patterns: mean F0 ‚â• 800 Hz, low F0 variability
- Burst lengths 100-500ms, repetition rate 1-2 Hz
- **Clinical Significance**: Genetic disorder requiring immediate evaluation

#### 4. **Weak Cry Pattern Analysis**
- Detects low amplitude cries with short voiced segments
- Compares against infant's baseline patterns
- **Clinical Significance**: May indicate SMA, botulism, or muscle weakness

#### 5. **Respiratory Distress (Grunting)**
- Identifies repetitive expiratory pulses (150-350ms)
- Strong low-mid harmonics at breathing cadence (0.5-1.2 Hz)
- **Clinical Significance**: Respiratory distress requiring immediate care

#### 6. **Serious Illness Alert**
- Continuous crying >5-10 minutes with abnormal spectral characteristics
- High-pitched inconsolable crying patterns
- **Clinical Significance**: Possible sepsis, meningitis - seek immediate care

#### 7. **Hearing Impairment Indicators**
- Higher mean F0, lower intensity, longer cry duration
- Uses lightweight classification on acoustic features
- **Clinical Significance**: Early hearing loss detection

#### 8. **Hypernasality Detection**
- Analyzes nasal vs oral energy ratios (250-300 Hz vs 500-1500 Hz)
- **Clinical Significance**: May indicate palatal or velopharyngeal issues
